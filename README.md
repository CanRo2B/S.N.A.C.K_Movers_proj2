# Difficultes and Sucesses 
  Some of the hardships we faced were the pursuit of getting all 4 of the API’s  (Census, Movers, Schools, Economic ) to work properly. Specifically when we were trying to fetch the data to link in our handlebars. Working with Bootstrap’s specific styling. As well as merging on GitHub with our pull and push requests.
 
 
 Our true triumph was getting all of our selected API data to run smoothly when called upon. Seeing the site in all its glory with our specified styling.

A huge thank you to the the amazing TA's and the other instructional staff in the UCF bootcamp. 

As a team we relied on our start-up code from our mini projects to frame and structure this project in which they described and gave us input as to what to do.
